frequency = 1h

# for backups shorter than one hour, the period duration must be defined
# in minutes. Because they are executed within a full hour, the selected
# value should divide 60 minutes without remainder so taken backups
# are apart in equal intervals. Values larger than 59 aren't practical
# as only one backup will be taken on each full hour in this case.
# examples:
# frequency = 15m -> four backup each hour 15 minutes apart
# frequency = 1h -> 24 backups each day
# frequency = 1D -> 365 backups each year
# frequency = 1M -> 12 backups each year
# frequency = 1Y -> 1 backup each year

# If the frequency is set to 0, we will not take backups for it

# Note that we will not take backups for a given type if that type is set to 0 above,
# regardless of the autosnap setting - for example, if yearly=0 we will not take yearlies
# even if we've defined a preferred time for yearlies.
