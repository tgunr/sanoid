# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

The Sanoid project directly supports both the code in the main branch, and the last two releases found here on GitHub.

Community support is available for all versions, with the understanding that in some cases "upgrade to a newer version" may be the support offered. 
If you've installed Sanoid from your distribution's repositories, we're happy to offer community support with the same caveat!

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you've found a serious security vulnerability in Sanoid, please create an Issue here on GitHub. If you prefer a private contact channel to disclose
particularly sensitive or private details, you may request one in the GitHub Issue you create.
